# Project: BirdsVsSpikes

This project is a simple game written in Python using the tkinter library for GUI and various other libraries such as time, random, and numpy.
This project was made during the AJST camp summer of 2018
### Getting Started
These instructions will help you run the game on your local machine.

## Prerequisites
Python 3.x and the following Python libraries installed on your machine:

1. Tkinter
2. Time
3. Random
4. Numpy

You will also need to have software installed to run and execute a Python code.

## How to Run
To run the script, you need to use a Python IDE that can run Tkinter. You can also use the command line and execute your Python file by using the command below:

python game.py

## Game Rules
The objective of the game is to keep the bird within the game screen and prevent it from colliding with spikes on either side. Additionally, collect cookies to increase your score.

The bird only moves horizontally in left and right directions. Players can make bird jump by tapping space on the keyboard. Avoid the spikes on either side of the screen to stay alive as long as possible.

## Game Controls
Space key: Jump
Enter key: Restart game

## Points
Player scores points based on time survived and cookies collected. Cookies randomly appear in the game-screen and the bird needs to collide with them to add to the score.
